# Kill MCP Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Auto-refresh: Process list now updates automatically every 5 seconds
- Configurable thresholds: RAM and CPU thresholds are now exported as constants
- Better error handling: User-friendly toast notifications when loading fails

### Changed
- Improved time parsing: Now uses `etime` instead of `lstart` for more robust parsing across different locales
- Better security: PID validation and use of `spawnSync` instead of `execSync` for killing processes
- Code refactoring: Extracted color functions (`getSourceColor`, `getRAMColor`, `getCPUColor`) to utils for reusability

### Fixed
- Removed unused `getSourceIcon` function
- Fixed potential command injection vulnerabilities in process killing
